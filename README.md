# Scheduling-Algorithms
This program an integrated program for the Scheduling Algorithms of Operating System (OS).
4 Scheduling Algorithms are included. They are 
                     
                     1. FCFS (First come first serve) algorithm
                     2. SJF (Shortest job first) algorithm
                     3. Priority scheduling algorithm
                     4. Round Robin algorithm
Input:
    Process name,
    Arrival time of each processes, 
    burst time, 
    priority,
    time quantum.

Output:
    Gantt chart,
    Turnaround time,
    Individual waiting time,
    Total waiting time,
    Average waiting.
